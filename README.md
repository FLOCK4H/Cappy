**Evil Twin** is a phishing technique categorized under network attacks, it involves the creation of a **rogue wireless access point (AP)** that masquerades as a legitimate network, such as a public Wi-Fi hotspot or a familiar network with a captive portal, to deceive users into connecting and unknowingly divulging their sensitive login credentials and other personal information transmitted over the compromised connection.
